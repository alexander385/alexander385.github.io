During my time with **UNICEF Hochschulgruppe N√ºrnberg** from **June 2017 to August 2019**, I contributed to local efforts supporting UNICEF's global mission of improving children‚Äôs lives worldwide. As part of the **UNICEF-Arbeitsgruppe N√ºrnberg**, I worked on raising awareness, organizing events, and fundraising for key initiatives.

### Key Contributions:

- üåç **Public Outreach**: Organized events like **Afrikatage** at the "Erfahrungsfeld der Sinne" and hosted benefit concerts such as **"Beats for Needs"**, promoting UNICEF's mission.
- üéì **Educational Programs**: Conducted **information sessions** at universities and schools to discuss **UNICEF projects** and the **UN Children's Rights Convention**.
- ü§ù **Team Building**: Recruited new members and fostered collaboration within the Hochschulgruppe.
- üéÑ **Fundraising Efforts**: Supported greeting card sales and other fundraising initiatives to finance global UNICEF projects.

These activities helped raise visibility for UNICEF‚Äôs work and engaged the community in meaningful ways. The experience taught me the power of grassroots initiatives and teamwork in driving social impact. I am proud to have been part of such a dedicated team working towards a better future for children worldwide.

    My journey with **UNICEF Hochschulgruppe N√ºrnberg** began after my experience volunteering in **2016 with Don Bosco**, where I worked with unaccompanied underage refugees. That experience inspired me to give more effort and help more people. When I saw that the UNICEF student group at my university was looking for new members, I realized it was a perfect opportunity to join and contribute further. I supported their mission by organizing impactful projects and events.

    One of the most meaningful parts of my work was conducting **educational programs** in schools. We introduced students to the **Children‚Äôs Rights Convention** using a tool called the **"School in a Box"**‚Äîa suitcase with basic educational materials to sensitize young children to the privileges we enjoy. These sessions fostered awareness and empathy, showing how vital education is for creating equal opportunities for all children.

    During **Afrikatage** and other public outreach events like those at the **Erfahrungsfeld der Sinne**, we organized mask-making workshops for children. These creative activities allowed us to engage young participants while spreading awareness about UNICEF's mission and the challenges children face globally. It was rewarding to connect with the community in such meaningful ways.

    Another highlight was organizing **benefit concerts** such as **"Beats for Needs"**, where local bands performed to raise funds. The revenue generated through ticket sales and donations supported UNICEF's global programs. These events brought the community together, showing how creativity and collaboration can drive impactful change.

    Reflecting on my time with UNICEF, I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute to raising awareness, educating young children, and organizing meaningful events. This experience deepened my understanding of how privileged we are and inspired me to consider creating my own non-profit organization in the future. In **August 2019**, I stepped back to focus on my **bachelor thesis**, but the lessons from this time continue to guide my perspective on making a positive impact in the world.

The code is simple.
Just wrap your images with `<div class="col-sm">` and place them inside `<div class="row">` (read more about the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/layout/grid/">Bootstrap Grid</a> system).
To make images responsive, add `img-fluid` class to each; for rounded corners and shadows use `rounded` and `z-depth-1` classes.
Here's the code for the last row of images above:

{% raw %}

```html
<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
  <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
  </div>
  <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
  </div>
</div>
```

{% endraw %}
