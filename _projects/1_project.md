During my time with **UNICEF Hochschulgruppe Nürnberg** from **June 2017 to August 2019**, I contributed to local efforts supporting UNICEF's global mission of improving children’s lives worldwide. As part of the **UNICEF-Arbeitsgruppe Nürnberg**, I worked on raising awareness, organizing events, and fundraising for key initiatives. I am proud to have been part of such a dedicated team working towards a better future for children worldwide.

    My journey with "UNICEF Hochschulgruppe Nürnberg" began after my experience volunteering in 2016 with Don Bosco Jugendwerk, where I worked with unaccompanied underage refugees. That experience inspired me to give more effort and help more people. When I saw that the UNICEF student group at my university was looking for new members, I realized it was a perfect opportunity to join and contribute further. I supported their mission by organizing impactful projects and events.

    One of the most meaningful parts of my work was conducting **educational programs** in schools. We introduced students to the **Children’s Rights Convention** using a tool called the **"School in a Box"**—a suitcase with basic educational materials to sensitize young children to the privileges we enjoy. These sessions fostered awareness and empathy, showing how vital education is for creating equal opportunities for all children.

    During **Afrikatage** and other public outreach events like those at the Erfahrungsfeld der Sinne, we organized mask-making workshops for children. These creative activities allowed us to engage young participants while spreading awareness about UNICEF's mission and the challenges children face globally. It was rewarding to connect with the community in such meaningful ways.

    Another highlight was organizing benefit concerts such as "Beats for Needs", where local bands performed to raise funds. The revenue generated through ticket sales and donations supported UNICEF's global programs. These events brought the community together, showing how creativity and collaboration can drive impactful change.

    Reflecting on my time with UNICEF, I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute to raising awareness, educating young children, and organizing meaningful events. This experience deepened my understanding of how privileged we are and inspired me to consider creating my own non-profit organization in the future. In **August 2019**, I stepped back to focus on my **bachelor thesis**, but the lessons from this time continue to guide my perspective on making a positive impact in the world.
