### Volunteering at UNICEF Hochschulgruppe Nürnberg

From **June 2017 to August 2019**, I was part of the UNICEF Hochschulgruppe in Nürnberg, a student-led initiative dedicated to contributing to UNICEF’s global efforts to improve children’s lives. I ended up joining almost by chance—one day I heard they needed more volunteers at the university—and my experiences at **Don Bosco Jugendwerk (2016)**, where I worked with unaccompanied underage refugees, convinced me that I should get involved. That earlier exposure to humanitarian work motivated me to keep volunteering and do more for those in need.

Being in the UNICEF Hochschulgruppe was special because we had students from a variety of faculties and universities in and around Nürnberg. We shared the common goal of raising awareness about children’s rights and advocating for better education, healthcare, and protection worldwide. Working together with people from different backgrounds showed me how powerful a collective effort can be when everyone is driven by genuine compassion.

#### School in a Box

One of our most meaningful projects was **School in a Box**. We would visit elementary schools in the Nürnberg area and give talks, demos, and hands-on activities to show young students here in Germany what daily life might look like for children in other parts of the world—especially places lacking basic educational resources. Through simple discussions and interactive materials, we helped these children appreciate how fortunate they are and understand why it’s essential to care about global inequality. This approach really opened up conversations about empathy and responsibility among both students and their teachers.

#### Creative Workshops

Outside the classroom, we took part in larger community events such as **Afrika Tage** and **Erfahrungswerte Sinne**. At these gatherings, we organized playful activities—like crafting animal masks with children—and used that relaxed atmosphere to talk about UNICEF’s work. It was surprising how quickly families and kids opened up during these fun moments, asking questions about what life might be like for children in underprivileged regions. Whether through conversation or simple games, these workshops helped sensitize people to the realities faced by young people across the globe.

#### Beats for Needs

We also put together a fundraising initiative called **Beats for Needs**, where we invited local bands to perform at benefit concerts. The idea was to gather the community around music, raise funds for UNICEF, and have a positive impact at both global and local levels. People were not only enjoying great live music, but they also learned about UNICEF’s mission and how even small contributions can help children in need. It was a fantastic way to bring everyone together—students, families, friends—and it felt like we were part of one big family, united by a meaningful cause.

### Reflection

Volunteering with the UNICEF Hochschulgruppe was truly eye-opening. I learned firsthand how local efforts can have a broader impact when people come together with determination and kindness. Eventually, I had to step back to focus on my bachelor’s thesis, but this experience left a profound mark on me. It inspired me to stay involved in nonprofit work and eventually led me to start my own **INOPIA Foundation** in 2020, carrying forward the ideals of compassion, collaboration, and a drive to make a difference.
