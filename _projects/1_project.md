During my time with **UNICEF Hochschulgruppe N√ºrnberg** from **June 2017 to August 2019**, I contributed to local efforts supporting UNICEF's global mission of improving children‚Äôs lives worldwide. As part of the **UNICEF-Arbeitsgruppe N√ºrnberg**, I worked on raising awareness, organizing events, and fundraising for key initiatives.

### Key Contributions:

- üåç **Public Outreach**: Organized events like **Afrikatage** at the "Erfahrungsfeld der Sinne" and hosted benefit concerts such as **"Beats for Needs"**, promoting UNICEF's mission.
- üéì **Educational Programs**: Conducted **information sessions** at universities and schools to discuss **UNICEF projects** and the **UN Children's Rights Convention**.
- ü§ù **Team Building**: Recruited new members and fostered collaboration within the Hochschulgruppe.
- üéÑ **Fundraising Efforts**: Supported greeting card sales and other fundraising initiatives to finance global UNICEF projects.

These activities helped raise visibility for UNICEF‚Äôs work and engaged the community in meaningful ways. The experience taught me the power of grassroots initiatives and teamwork in driving social impact. I am proud to have been part of such a dedicated team working towards a better future for children worldwide.

    Caption photos easily. On the left, a road goes through a tunnel. Middle, leaves artistically fall in a hipster photoshoot. Right, in another hipster photoshoot, a lumberjack grasps a handful of pine needles.

    This image can also have a caption. It's like magic.

You can also put regular text between your rows of images, even citations {% cite einstein1950meaning %}.
Say you wanted to write a bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, _bled_ for your project, and then... you reveal its glory in the next row of images.

<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    You can also have artistically styled 2/3 + 1/3 images, like these.
</div>

The code is simple.
Just wrap your images with `<div class="col-sm">` and place them inside `<div class="row">` (read more about the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/layout/grid/">Bootstrap Grid</a> system).
To make images responsive, add `img-fluid` class to each; for rounded corners and shadows use `rounded` and `z-depth-1` classes.
Here's the code for the last row of images above:

{% raw %}

```html
<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
  <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
  </div>
  <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
  </div>
</div>
```

{% endraw %}
