## My Time at UNICEF: Making a Difference for Children Worldwide

From **June 2017 to August 2019**, I was part of the **UNICEF Hochschulgruppe Nürnberg**, contributing to local efforts that supported UNICEF's mission of improving children’s lives globally. Together with a dedicated team, I raised awareness, organized events, and supported fundraising initiatives that made a tangible difference.

### Inspired Beginnings

My journey with UNICEF began after volunteering with **Don Bosco Jugendwerk** in 2016, where I worked with unaccompanied underage refugees. That experience shaped my resolve to help others and led me to join the UNICEF student group at my university. From the start, I found a platform where I could channel my energy into meaningful projects.

### Educating Young Minds

    One of the most impactful parts of my work was conducting **educational programs** in schools. Using tools like the **"School in a Box"**, we taught students about the **Children’s Rights Convention**. These sessions helped foster empathy and understanding while highlighting the importance of education in ensuring equal opportunities for all children.

    At events like **Afrikatage** and the **Erfahrungsfeld der Sinne**, we organized creative workshops such as **mask-making for children**. These activities were a fun way to engage families while spreading awareness about UNICEF's work and the challenges children face globally. It was fulfilling to see both children and parents connect with our mission.

    A key highlight was organizing events like **"Beats for Needs"**, a benefit concert featuring local bands. These concerts not only raised funds for UNICEF's global programs but also brought the community together. The energy and enthusiasm at these events demonstrated the power of collaboration in driving change.

### Reflections on My Journey

Reflecting on my time with UNICEF, I’m deeply grateful for the experiences and lessons I gained. Working with children, educating communities, and organizing impactful events taught me the value of empathy, teamwork, and creativity. While I stepped back in **August 2019** to focus on my **bachelor thesis**, the passion for making a positive impact continues to inspire me to consider starting my own non-profit organization in the future.
