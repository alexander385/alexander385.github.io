## My Journey with sneep Nürnberg: Driving Sustainable Change

In May 2017, I joined **sneep Nürnberg**, a vibrant student network for sustainability and business ethics. Sneep’s motto, “Many steps make a movement,” perfectly captures the spirit of our group—a dynamic, interdisciplinary team dedicated to making a difference both on and off campus.

### A Mission for Fair Consumption and Business Ethics

At sneep, I was part of the **Fair Consumption Team**, where we tackled the challenge of promoting sustainability and ethical behavior in everyday life. We organized impactful projects to raise awareness, spark discussions, and inspire action among students and staff at the **Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg (FAU)**.

One of our most notable achievements was leading the charge for FAU to become a **Fairtrade University**. This journey required strategic planning, effective collaboration, and a commitment to meeting the five key criteria set by the **TransFair** association. As part of the effort:

- We **formed a steering committee** that included students, university administrators, and representatives from campus dining services.
- We ensured that **Fairtrade products** were available at official university events, in cafeterias, and in dining halls.
- We organized and promoted **educational events**, such as workshops and campaigns, to engage the university community in meaningful discussions about fair trade and ethical consumption.

### The Moment of Recognition

Our dedication paid off when, on **April 8, 2019**, FAU was officially awarded the title of **Fairtrade University**. This recognition was a testament to the collective effort of sneep and our partners, including the **Studentenwerk Erlangen-Nürnberg**, which played a crucial role by integrating Fairtrade options into campus dining.

The Fairtrade journey was not just a symbolic achievement. It introduced tangible changes, like offering Fairtrade products at events and launching creative initiatives such as a **Fashion Revolution Week** and a **fair culinary city tour**, inspiring lasting cultural shifts within the university.

### Hands-On Impact: Organizing the Clothes Swap

In addition to the Fairtrade campaign, I led efforts to organize a **clothes swap event**, which quickly became a favorite among students. The event showcased how simple actions, like exchanging clothes, could challenge the fast fashion industry and promote more sustainable consumption. Managing the logistics and coordinating the event was a rewarding experience that strengthened my organizational and communication skills.

### Reflections on My Time at sneep

Looking back, my experience with sneep Nürnberg was transformative. It taught me how small steps—like choosing Fairtrade products or organizing a clothes swap—can collectively lead to significant societal changes. It also instilled in me a deep appreciation for teamwork and the power of grassroots initiatives to inspire institutional shifts.

Today, I carry the lessons of sneep with me, applying its principles of sustainability and ethics to every aspect of my life and work. Being part of the Fairtrade University initiative remains one of the proudest chapters of my journey, and I’m grateful to have contributed to making FAU a beacon of fair trade and conscious living.
