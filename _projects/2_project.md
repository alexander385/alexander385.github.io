### Volunteering at SNEEP

I joined **SNEEP (Student Network for Ethics in Economics and Practice)** in **2017**, after talking to the student group at my university. As someone who believes that responsible use of resources and adherence to moral principles are essential for good economics and business practices, I was immediately drawn to SNEEP’s vision.

#### Fair Consumption Project

A key initiative I was involved in was the **Fair Consumption** project at **Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg (FAU)**. Together with my fellow SNEEP members, we organized regular events during each semester to raise awareness about environmentally friendly choices and the importance of mindful consumption. We talked about topics like **organic food**, reducing **food waste**, and the idea of sharing food rather than discarding it. Our long-term efforts contributed to FAU being awarded the **Fairtrade University** title in **April 2019**, a milestone that recognized the campus’s commitment to Fairtrade products and ethical sourcing practices.

#### Clothes Swap Events

We also tackled **fast fashion** through **clothes swap** events. The goal was to encourage students and staff to think about the environmental impact of overconsumption. Swapping clothes with one another not only helped keep textiles in circulation longer, but also helped people reflect on the true cost of “disposable” fashion. It was exciting to see participants embrace this fresh mindset—one where sustainability and community were at the forefront, rather than convenience or habit.

### Reflection

My time at SNEEP strengthened my belief that real change starts gradually but grows steadily when people remain consistent and supportive of one another. We came together from different backgrounds, but we all shared the desire to push for more ethical and sustainable ways of doing business. This commitment to socially responsible economics taught me that we can be good economists without compromising on moral standards, and that even small actions—like choosing Fairtrade coffee or swapping clothes—can make a lasting impact if done collectively.
