## My Journey with sneep Nürnberg: Small Steps, Big Impact

In May 2017, I joined **sneep Nürnberg**, a student network committed to sustainability and business ethics. With the motto “Many steps make a movement,” sneep brought together like-minded individuals passionate about driving meaningful change.

### Championing Fair Consumption

As part of the **Fair Consumption Team**, I worked to promote ethical behavior and sustainability at **Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg (FAU)**. One of our biggest achievements was helping FAU earn the title of **Fairtrade University** in April 2019. This milestone involved forming a diverse steering committee, making Fairtrade products accessible across campus, and organizing educational events to inspire the community.

### Hands-On Projects and Lasting Memories

Beyond Fairtrade, I led efforts like a **clothes swap event** to challenge fast fashion and promote sustainable consumption. Seeing students embrace the idea of swapping rather than buying left a lasting impression on me. The teamwork and energy during these projects were unforgettable.

My time at sneep Nürnberg was unforgettable. It showed me how small, thoughtful actions can spark cultural shifts. The Fairtrade University campaign remains one of my proudest achievements, and the experience continues to inspire me to live and work with sustainability and ethics at the forefront.
