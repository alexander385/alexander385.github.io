### The Beginnings of INOPIA Foundation

The **INOPIA Foundation** started taking shape back in **2019**, when I was already juggling various student and volunteer initiatives—like UNICEF, SNEEP, and the Young Initiative at the Neues Museum Nürnberg. Through these experiences, I realized that I not only wanted to help people but also wanted to apply my **business and IT background** in a practical way. Originally, I considered launching a typical startup, but I also saw the potential in establishing a nonprofit—one that could **experiment with new ideas**, focus on real-world impact, and bring creative solutions to social challenges. By early **2020**, after navigating some pandemic-related delays, my friends and I officially founded the Inopia Foundation.

From the beginning, we decided to center our efforts on **education** and **sustainability**, inspired by the **UN Sustainable Development Goals** as well as my earlier work in organizations emphasizing resource stewardship and ethical leadership. This vision resonated with my colleagues, who all shared the same passion for bridging gaps and contributing to community well-being. In practical terms, INOPIA became our place for social innovation—a place where we could develop and test projects that might otherwise remain just ideas on paper.

#### Computer Refurbishment Project

One of our very first big projects was all about **Second Hand Second Chance - Refurbishing Computers**—an idea that was inspired by my mother. She observed that many companies replace their older PCs once they’ve been fully written off, even though these devices are still perfectly suited for tasks like schoolwork or online browsing. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we saw firsthand how the **digital divide** was widening as schools switched to online learning. Kids who didn’t have access to a computer were at an immediate disadvantage.

So, we partnered with local businesses—mostly **SMEs and family-owned places**—to **collect and refurbish** these discarded machines. We put free, open-source software like Linux on them so the children (and sometimes their families) could jump straight into online classes without worrying about costly licenses or hardware constraints. We also joined forces with the **Stabstelle Bürgerschaftliches Engagement** (part of Nuremberg’s Department of Social Affairs) to identify families in need and distribute over **250 computers** in total. It was really uplifting to see how something that simple—giving a child a working PC—could reduce educational gaps and bring us closer to the local community, including city officials and other small organizations who helped us along the way.

#### INOPIA One

After we got the computer project running smoothly, we realized that, well, just handing out hardware often isn’t enough. Lots of kids also need **tutoring**, or maybe they could use a “reading buddy” to practice their reading skills. That’s how **INOPIA One** was born—a unified **all-in-one solution** that brought together all of our educational help under one roof.

We used **JIRA** to create a **matchmaking system** so that volunteers could sign up, list their skills (e.g., math tutoring, reading sessions, etc.), and note the age group they’re comfortable working with. Families would then hop on the website, sign-up their child and the system would automatically connect them with a suitable volunteer. This not only streamlined everything (so people wouldn’t have to dig around multiple programs) but also made it really easy for new volunteers to see exactly where they could pitch in. It was a great example of how **IT and social work** can fit together seamlessly when you plan it right.

#### Greenopia: Ideas for Sustainability

From day one, **sustainability** was also a huge priority for INOPIA. We wanted to do something that would get the community more involved and let them share their own ideas. So we launched **Greenopia**, which was basically a little “ideation challenge” focused on three big issues.

1. **Sustainable mobility** (fewer cars, more eco-friendly transport)
2. **Reducing litter** (less garbage on the streets)
3. **Cutting down on food waste**

To make sure we were addressing the city’s real problems, we ran an **eight-week survey** asking people about **sustainability** issues they cared about most. We sent the survey to other non-profits, shared it on social media, and encouraged as many people as possible to take part. This helped us gather a wide range of opinions and insights from different parts of the community.

After that, we teamed up with local startup incubators like **Zollhof**, the **UmweltBank**, **Guampa** (a local, sustainable energy drink), and once again the **Stabstelle Bürgerschaftliches Engagement**. They provided things like **design thinking workshops**, prize money, and Goodies from our partners to motivate participants.

In the end, we received **four submissions** that tackled the key challenges identified in the survey. Two of the proposals focused on **sustainable transportation**, while the others addressed **food waste**. It was inspiring to see the creativity and thoughtfulness of the participants as they presented their ideas.

A jury made up of representatives from the UmweltBank, Zollhof, Guampa, and the City of Nuremberg came together to review the submissions and decide who would receive the top prize. Even though the entire event was held online, it was a rewarding experience for everyone involved.

Afterward, we packed up prizes and goodies (a mix of stuff from our partners plus the prize money) and personally delivered them to the winners. It was such a fun and rewarding project—it felt like proof that when you ask people for ideas and give them the tools to act on them, they can come up with some really amazing stuff.

Here is an overview of our results:

#### Ballot Bins for Sustainability

Another fun project we tested was introducing **ballot bins**—you know, those see-through ashtrays with two slots, so smokers can “vote” with their cigarette butts based on funny or provocative questions. It sounds goofy, but it’s a proven way to reduce street litter by giving smokers an interactive alternative to just tossing their butt on the ground. We placed a few bins at **Amar’s Barbershop** in Nuremberg, another barbershop in Fürth, and **Nordkurve** (a cultural venue in Gostenhof), and people actually loved it. Cleanup got easier for the owners, and it sparked fun little debates outside about the question being asked.

### Responding to the Russian War on Ukraine: Refugee Matchmaking and NFTs

In **February 2022**, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine triggered an enormous refugee crisis, and we saw an immediate need for help—especially in Germany, where a lot of Ukrainians were seeking safety. Because we already had the JIRA infrastructure and some technical know-how, we repurposed it as a **matchmaking platform** for Ukrainian refugees and local families willing to host them.

Families would register, agree to strict **GDPR** rules, and upload their ID documents for verification. Meanwhile, refugees could sign up (often through local nonprofits or the city’s own referral channels), and we used our system to coordinate everything. We also made sure to create PDFs in **German, Ukrainian, and Russian** explaining where to get healthcare, how to register kids in school, and so forth. Plus, we set up a small “Ukrainian help network” of local NGOs who held weekly or bi-weekly chats to troubleshoot and share info.

On top of that, we tried an **NFT fundraising** idea, asking Ukrainian parents if their kids had any drawings or artwork they’d like to share. We turned these into digital tokens on **OpenSea**, and actually raised over **€600**. The entire amount went to **Voices.org**, which offers psychological support and art therapy to kids who’ve been through trauma. Even though the NFT approach wasn’t perfect (we ran into high transaction fees and so on), it felt good to try something new that combined **tech and compassion**.

In February 2022, Russia’s unprovoked attack on Ukraine triggered one of the largest refugee crises in recent European history. Millions of Ukrainians were displaced, seeking safety in neighboring countries, including Germany. The magnitude of the crisis demanded immediate action, and INOPIA quickly pivoted to address this urgent need. Because we already had the JIRA infrastructure and some technical know-how, we repurposed it as a **matchmaking platform** for Ukrainian refugees and local families willing to host them.

Families would register, agree to strict **GDPR** rules, and upload their ID documents for verification. Meanwhile, refugees could sign up (often through local nonprofits or the city’s own referral channels), and we used our system to coordinate everything. We also made sure to create PDFs in **German, Ukrainian, and Russian** explaining where to get healthcare, how to register kids in school, and so forth. Plus, we set up a small “Ukrainian help network” of local NGOs who held weekly or bi-weekly chats to troubleshoot and share info.

Beyond providing housing, INOPIA also sought creative ways to support Ukraine. One of our most innovative initiatives was the NFT fundraising project, which leveraged the growing interest in digital art. We asked refugee parents to share drawings created by their children, many of which reflected their emotions and experiences of displacement. These artworks were turned into NFTs and sold on OpenSea, raising over €600. Every euro went directly to Voices.org, an organization providing psychological support to children affected by the war through art and music therapy.

This initiative highlighted INOPIA’s adaptability and creativity, combining emerging technologies with a deeply human cause. It also gave refugee children a platform to share their stories and experiences, turning their art into a means of healing and connection.

### Recognition and Reflection

At the heart of INOPIA was a team of 30 passionate volunteers, each of whom took ownership of specific areas such as fundraising, sustainability, events, and education. We encouraged autonomy and purpose, believing that motivated individuals could achieve incredible results. This decentralized approach fostered creativity and commitment, ensuring that every volunteer felt empowered to contribute meaningfully.

INOPIA’s efforts were widely recognized. We received the Young Engagement Award for our Computer Refurbishment and Ballot Bins projects, and we participated in the StartSocial Initiative, a nationwide competition for volunteering projects in Germany. These accolades validated the foundation’s work and underscored the power of community-driven solutions.

By late 2024, as many team members transitioned to full-time careers and I moved abroad to Kuala Lumpur for my studies, we faced challenges in finding successors to take over INOPIA’s leadership. Ultimately, we made the bittersweet decision to conclude the foundation’s journey. However, we reflected on our accomplishments with immense pride and gratitude.

The INOPIA Foundation was more than just a nonprofit—it was a testament to the power of purpose-driven action. From bridging the digital divide to promoting sustainability and supporting refugees, INOPIA left a lasting impact on the community it served. Though its journey has come to an end, the lessons and experiences it provided will continue to inspire us and others to strive for a better world.
