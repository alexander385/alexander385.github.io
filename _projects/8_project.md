### The Beginnings of INOPIA Foundation

The **INOPIA Foundation** started taking shape back in **2019**, when I was already juggling various student and volunteer initiatives—like UNICEF, SNEEP, and the Young Initiative at the Neues Museum Nürnberg. Through these experiences, I realized that I not only wanted to help people but also wanted to apply my **business and IT background** in a practical way. Originally, I considered launching a typical startup, but I also saw the potential in establishing a nonprofit—one that could **experiment with new ideas**, focus on real-world impact, and bring creative solutions to social challenges. By early **2020**, after navigating some pandemic-related delays, I officially founded INOPIA with a close-knit group of friends.

From the beginning, we decided to center our efforts on **education** and **sustainability**, inspired by the **UN Sustainable Development Goals** as well as my earlier work in organizations emphasizing resource stewardship and ethical leadership. This vision resonated with my colleagues, who all shared the same passion for bridging gaps and contributing to community well-being. In practical terms, INOPIA became our place for social innovation—a place where we could develop and test projects that might otherwise remain just ideas on paper.

#### Computer Refurbishment Project

Our first major initiative was the **Computer Refurbishment Project**, sparked by a simple observation from my mother: many companies throw away perfectly usable computers. As **COVID-19** shutdowns forced schools to switch to online learning, the digital divide between privileged and underprivileged children became painfully visible. We saw an immediate need for affordable or donated technology, so we **partnered with local businesses** to collect and refurbish their old PCs and laptops.

Using mostly open-source software like Linux helped us keep costs down and ensure these computers were ready for basic educational use. We then worked hand in hand with the **Stabstelle Bürgerschaftliches Engagement** (a civic engagement department in Nuremberg) to **distribute over 250 refurbished computers** to families lacking digital access. Beyond simply handing out devices, we found ourselves forming a supportive network with city officials, small-to-medium enterprises, and grassroots volunteers—all united by the goal of closing the technology gap for young learners.

#### INOPIA One

Building on the success of the refurbishment program, we introduced **INOPIA One**, a unified platform that combined our various initiatives—including **online tutoring** and a **reading partnership** (Lese Patenschaft) program. Our goal was to provide holistic support to children who might need more than just a device.

Using **JIRA** as a backbone, we designed an automated matchmaking system that connected volunteer tutors with students who needed help in specific subjects—be it math, reading, or general homework support. This tech-driven approach streamlined the process for both families and volunteers, creating an ecosystem where students could access educational tools, academic support, and reading practice in one place.

### Responding to the Russian War on Ukraine: Refugee Matchmaking and NFTs

In February 2022, Russia’s unprovoked attack on Ukraine triggered one of the largest refugee crises in recent European history. Millions of Ukrainians were displaced, seeking safety in neighboring countries, including Germany. The magnitude of the crisis demanded immediate action, and INOPIA quickly pivoted to address this urgent need. Leveraging the expertise we had developed with INOPIA One, we created a refugee matchmaking system to connect Ukrainian refugees with families in Germany willing to offer housing and support.

The system, built using JIRA, allowed families to register available space in their homes. To ensure the safety and privacy of all participants, the platform adhered to strict GDPR-compliant protocols, requiring families to consent to data sharing and upload valid identification documents such as passports or ID cards. This verification process added a layer of protection for refugees, ensuring they were matched with trusted hosts.

INOPIA’s matchmaking system worked closely with the city of Nuremberg and local organizations like the Ukrainian Cultural Club, creating a broad support network. The system’s automated nature ensured that matches were made quickly and efficiently, reducing the wait time for refugees in need of shelter. By the end of the initiative, hundreds of refugees had been connected with safe housing, demonstrating the power of technology to facilitate compassionate solutions during a crisis.

Beyond providing housing, INOPIA also sought creative ways to support Ukrainian families emotionally and financially. One of our most innovative initiatives was the NFT fundraising project, which leveraged the growing interest in digital art. We asked refugee parents to share drawings created by their children, many of which reflected their emotions and experiences of displacement. These artworks were turned into NFTs and sold on OpenSea, raising over €600. Every euro went directly to Voices.org, an organization providing psychological support to children affected by the war through art and music therapy.

This initiative highlighted INOPIA’s adaptability and creativity, combining emerging technologies with a deeply human cause. It also gave refugee children a platform to share their stories and experiences, turning their art into a means of healing and connection.

### Recognition and Reflection

At the heart of INOPIA was a team of 30 passionate volunteers, each of whom took ownership of specific areas such as fundraising, sustainability, events, and education. We encouraged autonomy and purpose, believing that motivated individuals could achieve incredible results. This decentralized approach fostered creativity and commitment, ensuring that every volunteer felt empowered to contribute meaningfully.

INOPIA’s efforts were widely recognized. We received the Young Engagement Award for our Computer Refurbishment and Ballot Bins projects, and we participated in the StartSocial Initiative, a nationwide competition for volunteering projects in Germany. These accolades validated the foundation’s work and underscored the power of community-driven solutions.

By late 2024, as many team members transitioned to full-time careers and I moved abroad to Kuala Lumpur for my studies, we faced challenges in finding successors to take over INOPIA’s leadership. Ultimately, we made the bittersweet decision to conclude the foundation’s journey. However, we reflected on our accomplishments with immense pride and gratitude.

The INOPIA Foundation was more than just a nonprofit—it was a testament to the power of purpose-driven action. From bridging the digital divide to promoting sustainability and supporting refugees, INOPIA left a lasting impact on the community it served. Though its journey has come to an end, the lessons and experiences it provided will continue to inspire us and others to strive for a better world.
