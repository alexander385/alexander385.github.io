### The Story of INOPIA Foundation

The idea for the INOPIA Foundation began taking shape in 2019, long before the world would face the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. At the time, I was actively involved in volunteering with organizations like UNICEF and SNIP—a student club dedicated to ethical business practices and sustainability. These experiences gave me a deep appreciation for the power of collaboration and innovation in addressing societal challenges. While I initially dreamed of launching a startup, I soon realized that the risks of building a for-profit venture were too high at this stage of my life as a business studies undergraduate. Instead, I redirected my ambition toward something deeply meaningful: creating a nonprofit organization that could make a tangible difference.

Inspired by the **UN Sustainable Development Goals**, I envisioned an organization that would focus on two critical areas: **education** and **sustainability**. I reached out to my university friends with this vision, and together we discussed how we could address these issues through practical, community-driven solutions. From the beginning, we were united in our desire to create something “people-focused”—an organization that could empower communities, grow independently of its founders, and deliver lasting impact.

INOPIA’s efforts were widely recognized. We received the **Young Engagement Award** for our Computer Refurbishment and Ballot Bins projects, and we participated in the **StartSocial Initiative**, a nationwide competition for volunteering projects in Germany.

By late 2024, as many team members transitioned to full-time careers and I moved abroad to Kuala Lumpur for my studies, we faced challenges in finding successors to take over INOPIA’s leadership. Ultimately, we made the bittersweet decision to conclude the foundation’s journey. However, we reflected on our accomplishments with immense pride and gratitude.
