### Volunteering at BDVB Hochschulgruppe Nürnberg

From **May 2019 to December 2019**, I was a founding member of the **BDVB Hochschulgruppe Nürnberg**, a student-led initiative under the **Bundesverband Deutscher Volks- und Betriebswirte (BDVB)**. This federal association serves as a networking and professional development platform for German economists and business administrators, representing their interests in economic discussions and facilitating career opportunities.

Our initiative brought together students from the **Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg (FAU)** and the **Technische Hochschule Nürnberg**, creating a valuable platform to connect with professionals, academics, and fellow students. We aimed to help students navigate their career paths through career consulting, workshops, and industry events.

#### Career Services and Professional Development

One of our primary focuses was offering **career consulting** to students nearing the end of their studies. Through a variety of **seminars, webinars, and networking events**, we provided valuable insights into job applications, career planning, and industry trends.

Key events we organized included:

- **KPMG Case Study (November 2019):**  
  A hands-on experience in audit and consulting, offering valuable insights into the industry. The discussions with professionals provided a clear perspective on career paths in finance and accounting.

#### Challenges and Growth

Starting the BDVB Hochschulgruppe was both exciting and challenging. Coordinating events, managing outreach, and balancing academic responsibilities required dedication and teamwork. However, the impact on students seeking career guidance and opportunities made it all worthwhile.

Unfortunately, the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted many of our planned activities, and as our academic paths evolved, my fellow students and I decided to step down from the group. Nevertheless, being a **founding member** of this initiative remains a source of pride, and I hope the group continues to grow and support students in their career journeys.

Reflecting on my time with BDVB, I value the connections made and the professional exposure gained. The experience of creating something from scratch and witnessing its growth taught me invaluable lessons in leadership, teamwork, and initiative.
