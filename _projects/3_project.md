## My Time with the Junge Museumsinitiative: A Path into the World of Contemporary Art

In **late 2016**, I joined the **Junge Museumsinitiative (jmi)**, a platform aimed at introducing young people under 35 to contemporary art and design. My time there provided me with unique insights into the art world and allowed me to contribute to cultural engagement efforts in collaboration with the **Neues Museum in Nürnberg**.

### Discovering jmi: A Personal Initiative

My journey began after I started collecting art posters, which led me to the initiative. Invited by the then-chair of the Museumsinitiative, I became a member and participated actively in **Museum Board Meetings** until 2019. These meetings were an invaluable opportunity to contribute to discussions about **art acquisitions** and **exhibition planning**.

### Creative Projects and Challenges

Our main goal was to create projects to attract a younger audience to the museum. One of our most ambitious ideas was an **Urban Art Festival** featuring street art and live music in front of the museum. Although this project wasn’t realized due to planning challenges, it was a valuable learning experience in event management and collaboration.

We did, however, successfully organize **pre-release tours** for our members, offering behind-the-scenes access to exhibition setups. These events allowed participants to experience the effort and creativity involved in creating compelling exhibitions.

### Reflections on a Unique Journey

Working with the Junge Museumsinitiative was a rewarding experience. It allowed me to connect with **artists**, **curators**, and the **museum director, Dr. Eva Kraus**, whose openness to ideas was truly inspiring. Though we faced challenges in member recruitment and project execution, my time at jmi deepened my appreciation for the art world and strengthened my interest in cultural leadership.

Looking back, this experience taught me the value of persistence, teamwork, and creative thinking. It inspired me to consider how I can lead my own initiatives in the future, fostering cultural engagement and making art accessible to broader audiences.
