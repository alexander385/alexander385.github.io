### Exploring Creativity Through Music, Art, and Photography

I believe that every creative pursuit—whether music, art, or photography—offers a unique way to capture the human experience. For me, creativity isn’t just about producing something aesthetically pleasing; it’s about expressing emotions, escaping stress, and living in the moment. These activities also have a positive impact on how I approach problem-solving in my professional life—reminding me to stay open-minded and think outside the box.

#### Composing and Playing Guitar

I started playing **guitar** in the **7th grade**, initially as a way to de-stress from school. Learning to play my favorite rock songs and, later on, forming my own band became an exciting outlet where I could immerse myself in music, share ideas with friends, and channel teenage energy into something positive. My band was called **Mickey Phantom**, and we played an indie-rock style that shaped my early musical influences.

Over time, I explored different instruments like **bass guitar** and dabbled in basic **music production** using **GarageBand**. I continue to experiment with new techniques and sounds whenever I can. You can hear some of my compositions—both solo work and collaborations with a friend—on my **SoundCloud**. Even though life gets busier, I always find myself returning to music for the sense of freedom and creativity it provides.

I’ve also started collecting guitars to accommodate various styles, each one bringing a different character to my music. As part of my creative pursuits, I built my own **guitar hanger/stand**, which you can see in one of the pictures below. This project combined my love for DIY crafting with my passion for music—an intersection that continues to inspire me to try new things, like learning drums or keyboard in the future.

#### Hiking Adventures: Climbing Mount Fuji

My time in **Japan** introduced me to **hiking**, an activity I initially never thought I’d enjoy. Yet, exploring the outdoors proved to be a powerful way to test my **willpower and perseverance** while reconnecting with nature.

A highlight of this journey was **climbing Mount Fuji**—standing at around 3,760 meters in elevation. The ascent was challenging, both physically and mentally, compounded by **altitude sickness** that reminded me of how small and fragile we are compared to nature’s grandeur. Still, reaching the summit felt like a profound accomplishment, renewing my determination to tackle new challenges and push beyond my comfort zone. I hope to set out on more hikes in the future, continuing to explore the world’s diverse landscapes.

#### Painting and Crafting

Art has been a constant companion in my life, manifesting in various forms like **painting**, **drawing**, and more recently, **street art** and **digital art** experiments. These creative outlets allow me to explore and express my thoughts, hopes, and beliefs.

One unique project was crafting a **Guitar Stand**, blending my passion for music with my love of hands-on building. Another, more collaborative endeavor, was the **Platz für Helfer (Place for Helpers)** chair—a **charity chair** that I designed alongside a friend. Inspired by our cultural backgrounds and the urge to promote solidarity, we used symbolic elements like a **Granatapfel** (pomegranate) and references to Ukraine. This chair was gifted to the founder of the Nordkorps in Nuremberg, complete with a QR code for visitors to make donations—supporting causes such as rebuilding efforts and fighting against anti-Semitism.

These projects underscore how creativity can serve a greater purpose—whether that’s bringing music to life or supporting meaningful causes. I’m eager to explore new techniques, mediums, and collaborations that fuse art, community, and social impact.

#### Capturing the World Through a Lens

Photography is another passion that has grown over time. Although I’ve enjoyed taking photos since I was younger, I only recently invested in a better camera to fully embrace the art of capturing moments and emotions.

During my stay in Japan, I used photography to preserve the vibrant landscapes, cultural nuances, and everyday scenes that resonated with me. Whether it’s photographing bustling city streets or tranquil countryside vistas, each shot reflects a desire to **pause time** and appreciate life’s fleeting beauty.
