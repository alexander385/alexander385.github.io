### Exploring Creativity Through Music, Art, and Photography

Creativity has always been an integral part of my life. From playing instruments to creating art and capturing moments through photography, I’ve found various ways to express my ideas, emotions, and passions.

#### Composing and Playing Guitar

I started playing guitar in the **7th grade**, and over the years, music has become a significant creative outlet for me. Although personal obligations have limited my time, I continue to practice and compose whenever possible. I primarily play **guitar** and **bass guitar**, using tools like **GarageBand** to record and produce music.

On my **SoundCloud account**, you’ll find some of my compositions—mostly indie-style tracks that reflect my creative journey.

#### Hiking Adventures: Climbing Mount Fuji

During my time in Japan, I discovered a newfound love for **hiking**, which became more than just a physical activity—it was a test of willpower and perseverance. One of my most memorable experiences was **climbing Mount Fuji**, a journey that challenged me both physically and mentally. Despite battling altitude sickness, I reached the summit, proving to myself the power of determination.

#### Painting and Crafting

Art has always been a way for me to express thoughts, hopes, and beliefs. Whether it’s through **painting**, **drawing**, or crafting, I find immense joy in creating something meaningful. One of my favorite projects was building a **Guitar Stand** (Gitarrenhalter) and a **charity chair**, **Platz für Helfer**. This chair was designed to reflect cultural diversity while supporting charities for Ukraine and Israel, promoting the fight against antisemitism.
