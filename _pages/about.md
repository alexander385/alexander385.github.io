Hello, and thank you for visiting my personal portfolio website! 😊✨

I’m excited to share a brief overview of my professional, academic, and personal journey with you. 🌍📚

🎓 **Academic Background**:
I hold a **Master of Science degree in International Information Systems Management** from the University of Bamberg in Germany. During my studies, I gained valuable experience across diverse industries, including insurance, education, finance, and healthcare. These opportunities allowed me to apply data-driven methods, data science techniques, and creative approaches like design thinking to enhance decision-making and improve project outcomes. 📊💡

🌏 **Global Experience**:
As part of my academic journey, I had the privilege of completing an exchange semester in **Kuala Lumpur**, **Malaysia**, in 2022. Studying at Universiti Putra Malaysia, one of Southeast Asia’s leading institutions, broadened my cultural horizons and earned me the Dean’s List Recognition for Academic Excellence. 🏅 Living in Malaysia, a vibrant cultural melting pot, enriched my understanding of diverse perspectives and deepened my appreciation for global collaboration. 🤝✨

I also interned at Bosch headquarters in **Yokohama**, Japan, as a strategy consultant specializing in competitive intelligence. This experience provided me with valuable insights into Japanese business practices and a deeper understanding of Southeast and East Asian markets. 🗾📈

💖 **Volunteerism & Community Impact**:
Beyond my professional and academic pursuits, I have been deeply committed to volunteerism for over eight years, contributing to organizations like UNICEF, SNIP, and Don Bosco. Additionally, I co-founded a non-profit organization focused on empowering disadvantaged youth and promoting sustainability. 🌱👩‍🎓 These initiatives reflect my belief in the importance of giving back to the community and creating a meaningful impact. 🌟

Thank you for visiting my portfolio! 🙏 I invite you to explore the projects and initiatives that have shaped my journey. I would love to connect and learn from your perspectives as well. 💬📧 Please feel free to reach out! 🚀
