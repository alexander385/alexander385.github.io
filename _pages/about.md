Welcome to My Personal Portfolio Website 🌍📊🎸

Hey there, I’m Alexander and I am a global citizen with a passion for data-driven insights, creative exploration, and the stories that connect us all. My professional and academic journey has carried me across Europe and Asia, from the historic charm of Bamberg, Germany, to the dynamic streets of Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, and the serene shores of Yokohama, Japan.

🌏 Bridging Cultures and Ideas

I believe that growth often comes from stepping beyond familiar borders and challenging one’s own assumptions. I’ve been fortunate to have had the opportunity to spend time abroad, immersing myself in diverse traditions and norms. These experiences have helped me develop a broader perspective and a deeper appreciation for different ways of thinking, which I strive to bring into both my professional and personal life. For me, travel isn’t just a break from routine—it’s a chance to learn, reflect, and gain insights that stay with me far beyond the journey itself.

At home, my collection of traditional folk masks serves as a vivid reminder of these journeys, each one representing the stories and cultures that have shaped my outlook.

📊 From Data to Decisions

Professionally, I am passionate about working at the intersection of data science, analytics, and strategic thinking. During my university years, I had the unique privilege of gaining hands-on experience across a diverse range of environments— from large enterprises to SMEs, startups (and incubators), and even within the academic setting as a university researcher. These experiences allowed me to observe and engage with how organizations of varying sizes approach challenges, adapt to change, and make critical decisions.

My industry exposure spans financial services, healthcare, transportation, automotive, and education, where I focused on transforming raw data into actionable strategies. Whether it was uncovering insights, optimizing processes, or developing meaningful solutions, I’ve come to see data as more than just numbers—it’s a narrative waiting to be understood. For me, every dataset holds the potential to tell a compelling story—one that drives smarter decisions, fosters innovation, and creates lasting impact.

🎸 Creativity 

In addition to my professional pursuits, music has always been a big part of my life. When I was a small boy, I dreamed of being a rockstar, inspired by legends like Jimi Hendrix and The Beatles. Whether I’m composing my own songs or jamming on my guitar and bass, music gives me a sense of joy and creative freedom. It’s a passion that stays with me, reminding me of those childhood dreams and the simple pleasure of creating something meaningful.

💙 Giving Back

I believe that giving back is one of the most meaningful ways to create connection and purpose. Since my university days, I’ve been fortunate to volunteer in a variety of areas, each offering its own unique challenges and rewards. From promoting sustainability at my university with sneep e.V. to educating young children about challenges through UNICEF, these experiences have deepened my understanding of the power of community.

Through the New Museum Initiative e.V., I had the chance to inspire young people to explore modern art, while co-founding the bdvb local chapter allowed me to organize workshops and case studies that supported students in their academic and professional development. Through the United Nations Society, I explored international topics and attended seminars to better understand global issues.

In 2020, my friends and I co-founded Inopia Foundation e.V., a non-profit aimed at supporting disadvantaged students and advancing sustainability. Although we had to close it due to the lack of a successor, the experience taught me the value of teamwork and resilience. For me, volunteering is more than just giving back—it’s about learning, growing, and making a positive impact that extends far beyond any single project.
